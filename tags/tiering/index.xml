Since fast access is essential for them, they use DRAM to store their data. DRAM is quite expensive and has limited capacity, so a solution we propose in this blog post is to use PMEM (and in the future other types of memory available through CXL - see a pmem.io blog post about it).</description></item></channel></rss>
