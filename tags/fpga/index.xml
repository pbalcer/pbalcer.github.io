While it is possible to support FPGAs and persistent memory in the same system, several factors need to be considered which include, but are not limited to the following:
Server size (1U, 2U, 4U, etc) Power Supplies Internal and external cooling functions - Air cooled, liquid cooled, or hybrid The type and quantity of persistent memory modules or devices within the system with their power &amp;amp; thermal requirements The make, model, and quantity of the FPGAs with its power and cooling requirements</description></item></channel></rss>
