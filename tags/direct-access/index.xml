Without DAX support in a file system, the page cache is generally used to buffer reads and writes to files, and requires an extra copy operation.
DAX removes the extra copy operation by performing reads and writes directly to the storage device. It is also used to provide the pages that are mapped into a user space by a call to mmap.</description></item></channel></rss>
