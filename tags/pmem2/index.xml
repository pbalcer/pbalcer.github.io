But that can also be one of its downsides for specific use cases. For example, if you want to use PMem as an ultra-fast storage device with low access latency.
PMem as storage impedance mismatch The reason for that is simple - block storage I/O is typically asynchronous due to its relatively high latency and high queue depths required to reach optimal throughputs.</description></item></channel></rss>
