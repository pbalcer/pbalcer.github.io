This is a meeting for developer project leads on the front lines of persistent programming, not sales, marketing, or non-technical management. This two-day event will enable leaders to learn what their peers have done, and want to do, with persistent memory, what worked, what was hard, and what was surprising.</description></item></channel></rss>
