To support data durability, Redis relies on creating periodical snapshots of data or logging all commands that reach the server.
When Persistent Memory was first introduced, we&amp;rsquo;ve started working on various approaches of using it in Redis. Apart from using its persistence, we also had its huge capacity at our disposal.
Our first approach focused on the replacement of the internal mechanisms of Redis' persistence by the persistency of the medium.</description></item></channel></rss>
