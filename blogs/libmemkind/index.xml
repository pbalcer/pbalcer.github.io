There are NVDIMMs technologies, such as Intel Optane DCPMM, that provides persistency, byte-addressability, and also a high capacity when compared with DRAM modules. They can be used as an expansion of main memory and utilized by applications which consume a large amount of memory and do not require persistency, such as in-memory databases, caching engines and scientific simulations.</description></item></channel></rss>
