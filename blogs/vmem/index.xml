They now live in a separate repository, and will follow their own release cadence. And, as these libraries are considered mature and finished, no new releases are planned once the split has been tested and tagged &amp;ndash; except for defects and new requirements of underlying platforms.
Further development libvmem remains the only way to use filesystem-managed persistent memory for volatile allocations on Windows.</description></item></channel></rss>
