A different, but very common, approach of doing exactly the same is to use a database with a specialized interface to manipulate the collection of data. MySQL is one such database, it processes SQL queries by calling (usually) multiple methods of the storage engine used for the data tables that query operates on. This tutorial covers basics of the pmemobj library, including non-transactional allocations and very simple transactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
