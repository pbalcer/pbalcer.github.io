Even with persistent memory pool allocators, convenient interface for creating and managing transactions, auto-snapshotting class templates and smart persistent pointers, designing an application with persistent memory usage may still prove challenging without a plethora of niceties that the C++ programmers are used to.
The natural step forward to make persistent programming easier, is to provide programmers with efficient and useful containers.</description></item><item><title>Using Standard Library Containers with Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/07/using-standard-library-containers-with-persistent-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/07/using-standard-library-containers-with-persistent-memory/</guid><description>Introduction Somewhere along the road, when we were doing the C++ bindings for libpmemobj, we found the need for some kind of containers. We were faced with two viable solutions: write everything from scratch or adapt an existing implementation. The obvious choice was NOT to implement from scratch. We would have to implement at least the basic containers from the C++ standard: vector, list, set, map and their multi- companions. That would be a lot of work, not to mention the testing and maintenance effort.</description></item></channel></rss>
