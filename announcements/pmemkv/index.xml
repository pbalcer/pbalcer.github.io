Iâ€™m pleased to announce that pmemkv 1.3 has been released and is available from our GitHub pages.
This release introduces a new experimental engine - radix (single-threaded sorted map, backed by libpmemobj-cpp&amp;rsquo;s radix_tree container).
We have also extended the configuration class API and redesigned the optimized version of stree engine.
